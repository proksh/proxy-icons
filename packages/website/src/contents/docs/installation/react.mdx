description: Installation guide for using Proxy Icons as React components.
---

## Installation Steps

1. **Install the Package**: Add the Proxy Icons package to your React project using npm, yarn, or pnpm.

   ```bash
   npm install @remixicon/react
   # or
   yarn add @remixicon/react
   # or
   pnpm install @remixicon/react
   ```

2. **Usage**: Import the desired icon and use it within your React components.

   ```jsx
   import { RiUserFill } from '@remixicon/react';

   const MyComponent = () => {
     return (
       <RiUserFill
         className="my-icon" // Add your custom class name here
       />
     );
   };
   ```

   Note: Replace RiUserFill with any icon component from the @remixicon/react package that suits your needs.

3. **Sizing**: Apply styles or classes to adjust the size of your icons.

   ```jsx
   import { RiUserFill } from '@remixicon/react';

   const MyComponent = () => {
     return (
       <RiUserFill
         className="text-xs" // If using Tailwind CSS or similar framework
         style={{ height: '20px', width: '20px' }} // Or use inline styles for sizing
       />
     );
   };
   ```

Note: The example shows using Tailwind CSS for sizing with text-xs, but you can customize this based on your CSS framework or design system.

## Additional Notes

- **Icon Import:** Only import the icons you need to keep your bundle size small.
- **Custom Styles:** You can further customize the icons using additional CSS classes or inline styles as required.
- **Responsive Sizing:** Consider using responsive classes or media queries to adjust icon sizes based on screen size.
